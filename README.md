# Budgeting App

This application allows the user to keep track of their expenses via an easy to use form and table system. The user fills out a form with information about their expense (cost, purpose, etc.), which is then placed in a table with all of their other expenses. In addition, there is a filter feature to allow the user to filter based on expense type.

## Technologies
